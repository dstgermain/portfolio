			<p>Hello! My name is Daniel St. Germain,</p>
			<p>I graduated from the New England Institute of art with an associate 
			degree in TV Broadcasting in 2006. After completing my degree, I started as an editor 
			for Comcast CN8 (a small television studio in Boston), after about a year I was asked 
			if I would like to apply for an open position in their graphic design department. 
			I seized the opportunity and worked in that position until January of 2009, 
			when the station was closed along with other New England studios and the stations 
			were reformatted into Comcast Sports Network.</p>
			<p>After working at Comcast, I began freelancing for a few local companies. 
			My daily work consisted of creating print advertisements, editing video, 
			creating animations, and the occasional website. In September of 2009, 
			I applied to a graphic design position at WHDH channel 7. After almost 
			4 years at channel 7, I took an opportunity at Karmaloop.com as a Front-End Developer. 
			I'm now a software developer at constant contact and I love what I do.</p>
