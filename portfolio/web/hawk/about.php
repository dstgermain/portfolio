      <p> As an appreciator of classic vintage aesthetic it's no surprise that Dan St. Germain found his way into vintage motorcycles. Long before knowing what lied ahead in the world of two wheeled speed chasing desire, he had his first introduction to Honda's and the thrill of movement on two wheels in his youth. </p>
      <p> "It was a 1969 Honda 50...I remember it like it was yesterday. Which is probably because it still sits in my fathers garage to this day, in mint condition. For what seemed liked years I waited, patiently...the rule was that I couldn't ride it until I could lift it off me should I dump it whilst trying to emulate Evil Knievel. When that day finally came I rode off down the driveway smiling from ear to ear. I washed, waxed and polished every square inch of that little two wheeled dream every weekend."
        Having grown up a bit, and able to lift a few hundred pounds, Dan got his first a few years back; a 1972 Honda CB360. He immediately began pulling it apart finding ways to perfect what he had with the tools at his disposal. One thing that stood out was the bulk dual gauge setup and aged indicator light panel. He went to the drawing board and the first of several products in the Hawk Concepts line-up was born. The single gauge aluminum dash. </p>
      <p> Dan utilizes a water-jet and the latest in technology to ensure quality product is produced and then, by hand, goes back and finishes each individual piece for a unique and period look. </p>
