Susannah and Daniel were engaged in September of 2013. Daniel suprised Susannah by taking her to the Ritz Carlton on Boston Common. He asked the question after dinner at the hotel. The two have been together for four years and counting. They had their first date at a small bar in Cambridge where they have both been before. The rest is history and they are both looking forward to their wedding in May of 2015.
