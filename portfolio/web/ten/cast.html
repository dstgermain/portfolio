      <h2>Molly Carlisle</h2>

      <h2>Molly Devon</h2>
      <p>Molly Devon is an actress and artist based in Boston. As someone who holds receiving an Oscar and acting in a B-movie on the same pedestal, it's no mystery why she was drawn to TEN. Restless in the world of academia, she decided to attend college part time and constructively pursue her desire to act. Countlessly finding herself lured into horror and thriller based roles, Molly is no stranger to the world of ghosts and fake blood. Her life motto which is freeing, blunt, and sprinkled with a dash of cynicism is: All of our lives will inevitably end, so dismiss comfort and make your risks while you can.</p>
